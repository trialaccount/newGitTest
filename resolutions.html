                Introduction and what we wanna visualize..

            <h2> <a name="visqueries">Visual Queries</a></h2>
            <p>
                With our visualization, we want to be able to answer the following questions:
            </p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li> What is the distribution of tweets per category throughout the nation or in a state? </li>
                    <li> How do the genders compare in different categories? </li>
                    <li> How do any 2 given states compare overall or in a particular category?</li>
                    <li> In which state is a particular category prevalent?</li>
                    <li> What is the spread of tweets per gender throughout the nation or in a given state?</li>
                </ul>
            <h2> <a name="design"> Initial Design</a></h2>
            <img src="initialMap.PNG">
            <br>
            <p>
                The initial design included a map and supporting graphs (below) to show discrete information about the data. We used a map in order
                to show all the data points in the data set at the same time and how they are spread out. Each point on the map represents a tweet
                and the location from which it was tweeted. Users can get all the information about a data point by clicking on it (shown on image above).
                The slider below the map allows users to select the range of time
            </p>
            <p>
                Above the map, there are checkboxes with each checkbox representing a category or a gender (male and female). This will enable a user select any number of categories and
                that would change the map to show only selected categories.
            </p>

            <h3> Implementation Of Feedback And Redesign </h3>
            <p> After the presentation of our initial design, we received feedback from Michelle and other students. We thought about how each of these points would affect our final visualization and made a few changes.</p>
            <h4> Use shape as well as colour for the symbol (category)</h4>
            <p> We thought the colors representing the categories were distinct enough and some of the symbols might be misinterpreted therefore we decided not to add symbols. </p>
            <h4> Compare two states</h4>
            <p>
                Users can compare only 2 states at a time. A state is selected by clicking on its location the map or by choosing it from the combo box. This changes the graphs as
                well therefore providing discrete information. Comparisons and be made between 2 states for a particular category or a single category.
            </p>
            <h4> Use both texture and colour for bar graphs </h4>
            <h4> Have a bit more of theme - resolutions - add appeal to your graphic </h4>
            <h4> Total resolution (category) "winner" of the state shown as a texture?</h4>
            <h2> <a name="imp"> Discussion</a></h2>
            <p>
                The final implementation is very similar to our initial design.This was expected as we did not get a lot of negative feedback after our 1st presentation.<br>
                With this visualization, we are able to:
            </p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li> Show all the information about each tweet and its location on the map</li>
                    <li> View all the information for only 1 state or category</li>
                    <li> Compare any 2 states</li>
                    <li> Compare any number of categories at the same time</li>
                    <li> Compare the 2 genders by each category and state</li>
                </ul>
            <h3> Strengths </h3>
            <p>
                The visualization is interactive and enables users to choose what information they would like to view at a particular time. Furthermore,
                the visualization covered the 4 main categories discussed by Ben Shneiderman. These are Overview, Zoom, Filter and Details on Demand.
                The map provided the overview while the interactivity provided the other 3.
            </p>
            <h4>Overview:</h4>
            <p>
                The map overview (before any interaction) allows a user to see all the data points at the same time. From this, the user can notice patterns or
                see which categories are popular in which areas.
            </p>
            <h4>Zoom:</h4>
            <p>
                Users can zoom into a particular state and will be able to view that information better. The graphs will also show discrete information about
                that particular state. Using the same functionality, comparisons can be made between 2 states.
            </p>
            <h4>Filter:</h4>
            <p>
                Filtering can be done on both the categories and the genders. This allows users to see information about a specific category in a specific state
                or on the entire map. Filtering also changes the graphs to enable users get more information about the category or gender they have selected.
            </p>
            <h4>Details on demand:</h4>
            <p>
                Clicking on a point on the map shows all the information about that data point on the map. This allows a user to get all the information about
                that tweet while having an overview in the background.
            </p>
            <h3> Weaknesses </h3>
            <h3> Conclusion</h3>
            <h2> <a name="team"> Team </a></h2>
            <p>
                The group worked together and used the <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> application for communication and file sharing.
                Google drive was also used to share files as well work collaboratively. All the members agreed on the final design. Some of
                the work was divided up among the 3 members in the following way:
            </p>
            <table cellpadding="10%">
                <thead align="left">
                <tr>
                    <th>Name</th>
                    <th>Work done</th>
                </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Michael Kyeyune</td>
                    <td>Implementation of the map and coordinates</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Thandile Xiphu</td>
                    <td>Implementation of the graphs</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>William Lumala</td>
                    <td>Editing HTML code and web page layout</td>
                </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
